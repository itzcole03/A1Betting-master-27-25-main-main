- **Historical Learning**: Use 24 conversations for pattern recognition
- **Sophisticated Preservation**: Maintain architectural integrity throughout repair
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track repair progress and system health

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Preservation

- **Decision**: Maintain sophisticated existing architecture
- **Rationale**: Platform represents significant development investment
- **Implementation**: Surgical repair approach, no simplification

### Memory Bank Integration

- **Decision**: Use Cline Memory Bank methodology with GitIngest enhancement
- **Rationale**: Proven approach from community with codebase analysis benefits
- **Implementation**: Structured markdown files with automated updates

### Chat Organization Strategy

- **Decision**: Multi-dimensional organization (date, topic, agent)
- **Rationale**: Different access patterns for different use cases
- **Implementation**: Parallel folder structures with cross-references

### Intelligent Duplicate Management (ENHANCED)

- **Decision**: Use sophisticated duplicate detection vs intentional variants
- **Implementation**:
  - TRUE DUPLICATES: Consolidate (e.g., MasterA1BettingDashboard â†’ A1BettingPlatform)
  - INTENTIONAL VARIANTS: Preserve (e.g., A1BettingPlatform vs A1BettingPlatformImmediate vs A1BettingQuantumPlatform)
  - SMART CONSOLIDATION: Use deprecation with re-export pattern for compatibility
  - VALIDATION: Always verify feature parity before consolidating
- **Rationale**: Different sophistication levels serve different users; performance variants serve different use cases
- **Guidelines**:
  - PRESERVE: Core platform variants, performance variants, API integration variants, ML model interfaces
  - CONSOLIDATE: Build artifacts, analysis files, true duplicates, abandoned features
  - VALIDATE: Feature parity, unique props, API integrations, business logic, user experience

## Current Challenges - Phase 2 Focus

### 2. Architectural Complexity Preservation

- **Challenge**: Maintain sophisticated 245+ component architecture during repair
- **Approach**: Surgical fixes with comprehensive testing
