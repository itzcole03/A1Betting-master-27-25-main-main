# A1Betting Platform - Project Brief

## Project Overview
A1Betting is a sophisticated sports betting intelligence platform that combines cutting-edge ML models with real-time data integration to provide users with advanced betting insights and predictions.

## Core Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript with QuantumSportsPlatform.tsx as the main interface
- **Backend**: FastAPI with 96.4% accuracy ML models using TensorFlow
- **Database**: SQLite with integrated ML model storage
- **API Integration**: Real-time PrizePicks API with rate limiting
- **Build System**: Vite for frontend, Python for backend

## Key Components
1. **QuantumSportsPlatform.tsx** - Main platform interface (1320 lines, 51KB)
2. **EnhancedUserFriendlyApp.tsx** - Alternative user interface
3. **ML Models** - TensorFlow-based prediction engine (96.4% accuracy)
4. **PrizePicks Service** - Real-time sports data integration
5. **Betting Logic** - Sophisticated financial calculation engine

## Critical Requirements
- **NEVER** simplify the sophisticated architecture
- **PRESERVE** ML model accuracy ≥96.4%
- **MAINTAIN** PrizePicks API integration integrity
- **PROTECT** betting algorithms and financial calculations
- **SECURE** user data and financial transactions
- **USE** surgical repair approach, not rewrites

## Current Status
- Backend: Fully operational on port 8001
- Frontend: Builds successfully on port 8173
- TypeScript Errors: 26,797 errors requiring systematic repair
- ML Models: Initialized and operational
- API Integration: Functional with proper rate limiting

## Development Approach
- Multi-agent coordination for complex repairs
- Plan-first, execute-second methodology
- Rigorous testing for financial calculations
- Preservation of existing sophisticated features
- Memory bank system for persistent agent knowledge

## Success Metrics
- TypeScript errors: Target <100 (from 26,797)
- Build time: <30 seconds
- ML accuracy: ≥96.4%
- Security violations: 0
- Architecture preservation: 100%

This project represents a high-value, sophisticated betting platform that requires expert-level development practices and careful preservation of its advanced architectural patterns.
