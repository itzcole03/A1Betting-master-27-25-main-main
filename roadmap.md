# A1Betting Platform - Production Readiness Roadmap

**Current Production Readiness Score: 45%**

This roadmap outlines the critical path to achieving a 99%+ production readiness score. It will be autonomously updated after each recursive deep scan of the workspace.

---

## **DEEP SCAN ANALYSIS (Update from Scan 33/60)**

**Finding:** The final error handling scan revealed that while some parts of the application have robust error handling, a common anti-pattern exists: logging only the `error.message` and discarding the full error object, including the critical stack trace.

**Conclusion:** This practice severely hampers debugging and incident response in a production environment. A strict, unified logging policy must be enforced to ensure stack traces are never lost.

---

## **PHASE 0: CRITICAL SECURITY & STABILITY REMEDIATION (TOP PRIORITY)**

**Objective:** Patch all known vulnerabilities and re-establish a baseline of quality and stability by fixing the entire test suite.

### **ACTION ITEMS:**

- **[ ] CRITICAL FIX 0.1: Remediate All Known CVEs and Dependency Vulnerabilities**
- **[ ] CRITICAL FIX 0.2: Replace Insecure `pickle` with Safer Alternative**
- **[ ] CRITICAL FIX 0.3: Fix, Improve, and Re-enable The Entire Test Suite**
- **[ ] CRITICAL FIX 0.4: Remediate Secret Management Risks**

---

## **PHASE 1: BUILD, TEST, & DEPLOYMENT PIPELINE REMEDIATION**

**Objective:** Create a single, reliable, and automated pipeline for building, testing, and deploying the application.

### **ACTION ITEMS:**

- **[ ] CRITICAL FIX 1.1: Unify and Simplify CI/CD Workflows**
- **[ ] FIX 1.2: Unify and Optimize Frontend Build Configuration**
- **[ ] FIX 1.3: Fix Dockerfile and Dependency Issues**
- **[ ] TASK 1.4: Implement Test Coverage Enforcement & Reporting**
- **[ ] TASK 1.5: Create Docker Compose Configuration for Local Dev**

---

## **PHASE 2: CODE & CONFIGURATION HYGIENE**

**Objective:** Clean up the codebase, unify configuration, and improve stability.

### **ACTION ITEMS:**

- **[ ] CRITICAL FIX 2.1: Consolidate and Rationalize API Versioning**
- **[ ] FIX 2.2: Refactor Backend "God Classes" & Resolve Circular Dependencies**
- **[ ] FIX 2.3: Unify Frontend State Management & Data Flow**
- **[ ] FIX 2.4: Centralize and Unify Configuration**
- **[ ] FIX 2.5: Execute the Stalled Component Consolidation**
- **[ ] FIX 2.6: Remediate Performance Anti-Patterns**
- **[ ] FIX 2.7: Refine Backend & Frontend Error Handling** (Revised from 2.8)
  - **Sub-Action:**
        1. **Enforce Centralized Handlers:** Replace all custom `try...catch` blocks with the centralized `safeExecute` wrappers.
        2. **Eliminate Silent Failures:** Ensure error handlers themselves do not swallow errors.
        3. **Replace Generic `except`:** Replace generic backend exceptions with specific ones.
        4. **NEW - Always Log Full Error Object:** Audit all error logging calls (`logger.error`, `console.error`, etc.) and ensure the *full error object* is passed to the logger, never just `error.message`. This preserves the stack trace.

- **[ ] FIX 2.8: Eliminate Dead & Unused Code** (Formerly 2.7)
- **[ ] FIX 2.9: Resolve Documentation Debt and Incomplete Features** (Formerly 2.8)
- **[ ] FIX 2.10: Remove Production Console Statements** (Formerly 2.9)
- **[ ] FIX 2.11: Eliminate All Production Mock Implementations** (Formerly 2.10)
- **[ ] FIX 2.12: Address Deceptive "Stub" Implementations** (Formerly 2.11)
- **[ ] TASK 2.13: Environment Variable Validation**
- **[ ] TASK 2.14: Archive Stale Migration Scripts**

---

## **PHASE 3: FINAL CLEANUP & DOCUMENTATION**

**Objective:** Remove all remaining project clutter and create a single, trustworthy set of documentation.

### **ACTION ITEMS:**

- **[ ] TASK 3.1: Clean and Organize the Root Directory**
- **[ ] TASK 3.2: Create a Definitive `README.md`**
- **[ ] TASK 3.3: Archive Stale Migration & Analysis Scripts**
- **[ ] TASK 3.4: Enhance Integration Test Coverage**
- **[ ] TASK 3.5: Create an End-to-End Build & Test Script**

# Project Roadmap

## Milestones
- [x] Backend and frontend architecture established
- [x] PrizePicks API integration (mock and real)
- [x] ML model integration and value scoring
- [x] UI dashboards (Money Maker Pro, PrizePicks Pro, PropOllama)
- [x] Error handling and fallback logic
- [x] Logging and monitoring
- [x] Unit and integration tests
- [x] Cursor best practices and project rules integrated

## Next Steps
- [ ] Obtain and securely add real API credentials
- [ ] Finalize rate limiting and retry logic for API calls
- [ ] Remove all mock data for production
- [ ] Add user-facing error messages for API failures
- [ ] Expand test coverage for edge cases
- [ ] Review and update .cursor/rules/*.mdc as project evolves
- [ ] Maintain instructions.md and roadmap.md for project clarity

## Cursor Integration
- Project rules in .cursor/rules/*.mdc
- Project instructions in instructions.md
- Roadmap and milestones in roadmap.md
- Use Agent Mode and @-commands for efficient, context-aware development

This roadmap is a living document. It will be continuously updated as the autonomous agent performs deep scans and analyzes the codebase.
