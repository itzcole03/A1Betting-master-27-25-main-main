# A1Betting Platform - Best Practices

## TypeScript Repair
- Systematically address all TypeScript errors using autonomous repair cycles.
- Prioritize critical adapters and components.
- Validate after each repair with incremental testing.

## Autonomous Mode
- Enable multi-agent coordination for parallel repair and optimization.
- Use memory bank for persistent context and progress tracking.
- Continuously validate architecture and system health.

## Testing Coverage
- Ensure all new features/components have corresponding tests.
- Use automated frameworks for continuous integration.
- Target >90% coverage for critical modules.

## Performance Optimization
- Monitor build times and optimize for <30 seconds.
- Profile and optimize backend and frontend performance.
- Use caching and efficient data pipelines.

## Memory Bank Updates
- Regularly update memory bank with progress, context, and lessons learned.
- Use memory bank for agent coordination and persistent learning.

## Multi-Agent Coordination
- Leverage multiple agents for parallel repair and development.
- Use chat archives and codebase context for intelligent decision-making.
- Validate all changes with quality assurance and incremental testing.

## Additional Best Practices
- Maintain architectural preservation during all repairs.
- Document all changes and lessons learned.
- Use audit reports and progress tracking for continuous improvement.
