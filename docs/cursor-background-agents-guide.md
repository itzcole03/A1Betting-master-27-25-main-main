# Cursor Background Agents Guide for A1Betting Platform

## Overview

Background agents in Cursor provide continuous monitoring and automated assistance for the A1Betting platform development. This guide explains how to configure and utilize these agents for optimal development efficiency.

## Background Agent Types

### 1. TypeScript Error Monitor Agent

**Purpose**: Continuously monitor and auto-fix TypeScript errors
**A1Betting Tasks**:

- Monitor the 26,797 TypeScript errors
- Auto-fix `,`n corruption patterns
- Repair template literal malformation
- Resolve import path issues
- Preserve existing type definitions

### 2. Build Status Monitor Agent

**Purpose**: Track build status and alert on failures
**A1Betting Tasks**:

- Monitor Vite build process (currently succeeding)
- Track TypeScript compilation status
- Alert on backend ML model failures
- Monitor real-time data pipeline health

### 3. ML Model Performance Agent

**Purpose**: Monitor ML model accuracy and performance
**A1Betting Tasks**:

- Monitor 96.4% accuracy threshold
- Track TensorFlow model performance
- Monitor real-time prediction pipeline
- Alert on model degradation

### 4. Security Scanning Agent

**Purpose**: Continuous security monitoring for betting platform
**A1Betting Tasks**:

- Scan for exposed API keys or secrets
- Monitor betting algorithm exposure
- Check financial calculation security
- Audit trail monitoring

### 5. Code Quality Agent

**Purpose**: Maintain code quality standards
**A1Betting Tasks**:

- Monitor component complexity (QuantumSportsPlatform.tsx = 1320 lines OK)
- Preserve sophisticated architecture
- Maintain documentation standards
- Check code quality without simplification

## Agent Activation Commands

### Enable Background Agents

```bash
# In Cursor command palette (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P)
> Cursor: Enable Background Agents
> Cursor: Configure Background Agents
> Cursor: Show Agent Status
```

## A1Betting Platform Agent Workflow

### Phase 1: Initial Setup

1. Enable TypeScript Error Monitor for `,`n corruption
2. Configure Build Monitor for Vite and FastAPI
3. Set up ML Performance monitoring for 96.4% accuracy
4. Enable Security Scanner for betting platform protection

### Phase 2: Active Development

1. TypeScript Agent auto-fixes syntax errors
2. Build Monitor alerts on compilation failures
3. ML Agent tracks model performance
4. Security Agent prevents sensitive data exposure
5. Quality Agent maintains architectural integrity

### Phase 3: Continuous Monitoring

1. Agents run in background during development
2. Real-time alerts for critical issues
3. Automated fixes for simple problems
4. Human intervention for complex issues

## Best Practices

### Agent Management

1. **Prioritize Critical Agents**: Security and TypeScript monitors first
2. **Monitor Agent Performance**: Check logs regularly
3. **Balance Automation**: Auto-fix simple issues, human review complex ones
4. **Resource Management**: Disable non-essential agents during heavy development

### A1Betting Specific Guidelines

1. **Preserve Architecture**: Agents should never simplify sophisticated components
2. **Security First**: Security agent has highest priority for betting platform
3. **ML Model Protection**: Monitor model performance continuously
4. **Financial Data Safety**: Extra security for monetary calculations

This guide ensures optimal utilization of Cursor's background agents for the sophisticated A1Betting platform while maintaining security, performance, and architectural integrity.
