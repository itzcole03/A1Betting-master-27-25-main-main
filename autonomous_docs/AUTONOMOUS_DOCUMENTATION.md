## Deployment Guide

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+
- PostgreSQL 13+
- Redis 6+
- Nginx

### Autonomous Deployment Steps

1. **Clone Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
   Clone the A1Betting repository with autonomous capabilities

2. **Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   cp backend/.env.production backend/.env
   ```
   Copy production environment configuration

3. **Autonomous System Setup**
   ```bash
   python setup_autonomous_systems.py
   ```
   Initialize autonomous monitoring and optimization systems

4. **Database Setup**
   ```bash
   python backend/deploy_production.py
   ```
   Run automated production deployment

5. **Frontend Build**
   ```bash
   cd frontend && npm install && npm run build
   ```
   Build frontend for production

6. **Start Autonomous Services**
   ```bash
   python start_autonomous_operations.py
   ```
   Start autonomous monitoring, optimization, and self-healing

### Verification
- Check https://localhost for frontend
- Check https://localhost/api/docs for API documentation
- Check https://localhost/api/health for system health
- Check autonomous_log.txt for autonomous operations
- Verify autonomous systems are running with ps aux | grep autonomous

# A1Betting Platform: Enterprise Handoff & Continuous Enhancement

## Final State
- All analytics, ML, and UI features are robust, type-safe, and production-ready
- Analytics dashboard is fully integrated and visible in the main UI
- No blank or export {} components remain in production
- All navigation, features, and analytics validated as robust and error-free

## Continuous Autonomous Enhancement Protocol
- Recursive, type-safe enhancement loop enabled for ongoing polish and feature upgrades
- Never regress on type safety or code quality
- Maintain full audit trail and documentation
- Only enhance, never overwrite working features

## Deployment Instructions
1. **Environment Requirements**
   - Node.js v18+ (avoid v22 until Vite/Console Ninja support is confirmed)
   - Vite v6.3.5 or compatible
   - All secrets and API keys must be set via environment variables (never hardcoded)
   - Backend (FastAPI) and database (SQLite/PostgreSQL/Redis) must be running and accessible
2. **Build & Start**
   - `npm install`
   - `npm run build`
   - `npm run start` (or `npm run dev` for development)
3. **Security Best Practices**
   - Use .env files for all sensitive configuration
   - Never log or expose secrets, API keys, or financial data
   - Validate all user input and sanitize external data
   - Implement audit trails for all betting operations and financial transactions

## Best Practices
- Maintain comprehensive documentation and code comments
- Use type hints for all financial and ML functions
- Validate all financial calculations with multiple methods
- Monitor ML model accuracy and system health continuously
- Update memory bank and documentation with all changes
